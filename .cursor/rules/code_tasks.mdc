# Code and Tasks Guidelines

## Technical Assumptions
- I am technically proficient
- I have ffmpeg installed and know how to use it
- I know how to use git
- I will handle git operations (push, pull, etc.) myself
- I will handle file/folder deletions myself when needed

## Task Approach
- Before implementing code changes, provide thoughtful explanation of:
  - The approach being taken
  - Which files will be modified and why
  - Overall solution strategy
- During implementation, explain changes as they are made to facilitate better review
- Provide concise summary of changes at the end of implementation
- Focus on clear reasoning and explanation rather than rushing into code

## Communication Style
- Technical and direct
- Assume competence but explain reasoning
- No need to explain basic concepts
- Focus on solution design and implementation details
