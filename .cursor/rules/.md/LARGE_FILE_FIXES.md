# Large File Handling Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. UUID Handling Error ✅
**Problem**: `'str' object has no attribute 'hex'` error when processing sessions
**Solution**: Fixed UUID conversion in `process_session()` function
- Changed `Session.id == session_id` to `Session.id == uuid.UUID(session_id)`
- Applied fix to both main query and error handling

### 2. File Size Limits ✅
**Problem**: 100MB limit was too restrictive for large RPG sessions
**Solution**: Increased limits and added intelligent handling
- Increased app limit from 100MB to 500MB
- Added clear distinction between app limit (500MB) and Whisper API limit (25MB)
- Added validation for both limits with appropriate error messages

### 3. Large File User Experience ✅
**Problem**: Users didn't know how to handle files > 25MB
**Solution**: Added comprehensive compression guidance
- Built-in compression recommendations based on file format
- Step-by-step Audacity instructions
- FFmpeg commands for advanced users
- Estimated compression ratios and file sizes

## New Features Added

### 1. Audio Compression Helper (`src/utils/audio_compression.py`)
- Format-specific compression recommendations
- Estimated size calculations
- Tool recommendations (Audacity, FFmpeg, etc.)
- Step-by-step instructions

### 2. Enhanced File Validation
- Better error messages with specific guidance
- Processing time estimates
- File format-specific recommendations
- Automatic cleanup of invalid files

### 3. Improved User Interface
- Clear file size warnings and limits
- Expandable compression guidance
- Processing time estimates
- Better error handling and feedback

## Configuration Changes

### Updated Defaults
```env
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=500  # Increased from 100
CHUNK_SIZE_MB=25      # New: for future chunking support
ENABLE_STREAMING=true # New: for future streaming support
```

### New Settings Properties
- `chunk_size_bytes`: For large file processing
- Enhanced validation with detailed error messages
- Better timeout handling for large files

## User Experience Improvements

### For 52MB File (Your Case)
1. **Before**: Generic "file too large" error
2. **After**: 
   - Clear explanation of 25MB Whisper limit
   - Estimated compressed size (e.g., 5.2MB for WAV→MP3)
   - Step-by-step Audacity instructions
   - FFmpeg commands ready to copy-paste

### For 500MB File
1. **Before**: Would be rejected immediately
2. **After**:
   - Accepted by app (under 500MB limit)
   - Clear guidance that compression is required
   - Detailed recommendations for massive size reduction
   - Multiple compression strategies provided

## Technical Improvements

### Error Handling
- Better exception handling for large files
- Timeout configuration based on file size
- Graceful degradation with helpful error messages

### Performance
- Added timeout settings for large file processing
- File size warnings and estimates
- Better memory management for large uploads

### Validation
- Two-tier validation (app limit vs API limit)
- Format-specific recommendations
- Proactive file cleanup on errors

## Usage Instructions

### For Users with Large Files
1. Upload your file (up to 500MB)
2. If > 25MB, follow the compression guidance provided
3. Use Audacity (recommended) or FFmpeg to compress
4. Re-upload the compressed file
5. Process normally

### Compression Examples
- **WAV (100MB) → MP3**: ~10MB (90% reduction)
- **FLAC (80MB) → MP3**: ~24MB (70% reduction)
- **M4A (40MB) → MP3**: ~24MB (40% reduction)

## Testing

All fixes have been tested and verified:
- ✅ UUID handling works correctly
- ✅ File size validation works for both limits
- ✅ Compression recommendations display properly
- ✅ Error handling is graceful
- ✅ All imports and dependencies work

The application is now ready to handle large audio files with intelligent guidance for users.
